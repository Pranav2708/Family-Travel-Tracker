# Family-Travel-Tracker
A Family Travel Tracker, built with CSS, JS, Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL, allows each family member to highlight countries they've visited on a shared world map in their chosen colours. The platform supports adding new family members, each selecting their unique colours and stores all data securely in a PostgreSQL database. This interactive tool offers a colourful and engaging way to visualize and compare travel experiences within the family.
